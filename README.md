# Kamal-Hotstar-Clone
It is a frontend project made by html, css, javscript and bootstrap.
I used html to make the outline of project. And css in styling.
Bootstrap helped in the most important parts like navbar, carousel.
I made grid layout system to align the items in the form of grid layout.
And provided javascript to search the user inputs.
we can take this project to understand most important concepts of web development.
